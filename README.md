# helloWorld

Whats up guysss. This is my first repo on Git. I love gadgeties, techies, and all those -ies es! As of Feb. 20, 2016, I'm able to code in Python (I'm using version 2.x) and C++. At this very moment (Feb. 20, 2016), I have a programming course at school and my teacher is freaking awesome (if you're wondering who he is, Google: Robert Arkiletian).

You can follow me on Instagram and Tw at this handle EugeneOnTheEdge
